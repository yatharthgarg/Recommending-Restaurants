# Recommending-Restaurants

### About
This is a project where I used **BeautifulSoup**  to web scrape data from a post by [Timeout](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/restaurants/100-best-new-york-restaurants) regarding the 100 best restaurants in New York. 
I web scraped throught the data and extracted 4 main features - 

• Name of the restaurant

• Details about the restaurant

• Location

• Cuisine

Eventually I used **cosine-similarity** for matching the features and recommending the restaurant to the user. I will be updating the repository for multiple web-pages by time-out to improve my model.
